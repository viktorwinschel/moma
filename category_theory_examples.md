# Category Theory in Moma

This guide explains how to use Moma's category theory framework for modeling and analysis.

## Basic Concepts

### Objects and Morphisms

The fundamental building blocks in Moma are:

- `Object`: Represents a mathematical object with a unique identifier and data
- `Morphism`: Represents a transformation between objects with source, target, and mapping function

```julia
# Create objects
x = Object(:x, 42)
y = Object(:y, "hello")

# Create a morphism
f = Morphism(x, y, x -> string(x), :f)
```

### Categories

A `Category` consists of:
- A collection of objects
- A collection of morphisms between those objects
- Composition of morphisms
- Identity morphisms

```julia
# Create a category
C = Category([x, y], [f], :MyCategory)
```

### Functors

A `Functor` maps between categories:
- Maps objects to objects
- Maps morphisms to morphisms
- Preserves composition and identities

```julia
# Create a functor
F = Functor(C, D, 
    Dict(x => x′, y => y′),
    Dict(f => f′),
    :MyFunctor)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Data Types

Moma supports custom data types through the `Object` type:

```julia
# Define a custom type
struct Point
    x::Float64
    y::Float64
end

# Create objects with custom data
p1 = Object(:p1, Point(1.0, 2.0))
p2 = Object(:p2, Point(3.0, 4.0))

# Create morphisms between custom objects
f = Morphism(p1, p2, p -> Point(p.x + 1, p.y + 1), :translate)
```

### Error Handling

Moma provides error handling for common category theory operations:

```julia
# Composition of incompatible morphisms
try
    compose(f, g)  # Will throw if f.target ≠ g.source
catch e
    println("Composition error: ", e)
end

# Invalid functor mapping
try
    F = Functor(C, D, invalid_mapping, :InvalidFunctor)
catch e
    println("Functor error: ", e)
end
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use meaningful identifiers for objects and morphisms
2. Document the purpose of categories and functors
3. Handle errors appropriately in production code
4. Use type annotations for better code clarity
5. Test compositions and functor applications

## Common Patterns

### Pattern Matching

Use patterns to match and transform objects:

```julia
# Create a pattern
P = Pattern([x, y], [f], :MyPattern)

# Match against objects
if matches(P, objects)
    # Apply pattern transformation
end
```

### Natural Transformations

Define transformations between functors:

```julia
# Create a natural transformation
η = NaturalTransformation(F, G, 
    Dict(x => morphism_x, y => morphism_y),
    :MyTransformation)
```

## Performance Considerations

1. Use immutable objects when possible
2. Cache frequently used compositions
3. Minimize object creation in tight loops
4. Profile category operations for bottlenecks
5. Consider using specialized data structures for large categories
