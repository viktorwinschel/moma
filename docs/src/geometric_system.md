# Geometric System

Category theory provides a powerful framework for handling geometric systems by offering a structured way to represent and manipulate geometric objects and their relationships. This approach has several key benefits:

1. **Structured Representation**: Geometric objects (points, lines, shapes) can be represented as objects in a category, while geometric transformations (translations, rotations, scaling) are represented as morphisms between these objects.

2. **Composition of Transformations**: Category theory's composition rules naturally capture how geometric transformations can be combined. For example, a rotation followed by a translation can be represented as the composition of two morphisms.

3. **Invariant Properties**: The categorical framework helps maintain geometric invariants. For instance, when we define a morphism that transforms a point into a line, we can ensure it preserves important geometric properties.

4. **Pattern Recognition**: Categories allow us to identify and work with geometric patterns as subcategories, making it easier to recognize and manipulate recurring geometric structures.

5. **Hierarchical Organization**: Complex geometric systems can be organized hierarchically using categories and subcategories, reflecting the natural structure of geometric relationships.

The following example demonstrates how we can implement these concepts using our category theory framework:

```julia
using Moma

# Define custom data types for geometric objects
# Point represents a 2D point with x and y coordinates
struct Point
    x::Float64
    y::Float64
end

# Line represents a line segment with start and end points
struct Line
    start::Point
    ends::Point
end

# Create objects in our category using the custom data types
# Each object has a unique identifier (symbol) and associated data
p1 = Object(:P1, Point(0.0, 0.0))  # Point at origin
p2 = Object(:P2, Point(1.0, 1.0))  # Point at (1,1)
l1 = Object(:L1, Line(Point(0.0, 0.0), Point(1.0, 1.0)))  # Line from origin to (1,1)

# Verify that objects are created correctly by checking their data
# This ensures our objects maintain their geometric properties
@assert p1.data.x == 0.0
@assert p1.data.y == 0.0
@assert p2.data.x == 1.0
@assert p2.data.y == 1.0
@assert l1.data.start.x == 0.0
@assert l1.data.start.y == 0.0
@assert l1.data.ends.x == 1.0
@assert l1.data.ends.y == 1.0
@assert p1.id == :P1
@assert p2.id == :P2
@assert l1.id == :L1

# Create a morphism that transforms a point into a line
# This morphism takes a point and creates a line from that point to a point 1 unit right and up
f = Morphism(p1, l1, p -> Line(p, Point(p.x + 1.0, p.y + 1.0)), :f)

# Verify that the morphism correctly transforms the point into a line
# This ensures our morphisms preserve geometric relationships
result = f.map(p1.data)
@assert result.start.x == 0.0
@assert result.start.y == 0.0
@assert result.ends.x == 1.0
@assert result.ends.y == 1.0
@assert f.id == :f
@assert f.source == p1
@assert f.target == l1

# Create a category that contains our geometric objects and morphisms
# This category represents our geometric system
geom_cat = Category([p1, p2, l1], [f], :Geometry)
@assert length(geom_cat.objects) == 3
@assert length(geom_cat.morphisms) == 1
@assert geom_cat.id == :Geometry
@assert p1 in geom_cat.objects
@assert p2 in geom_cat.objects
@assert l1 in geom_cat.objects
@assert f in geom_cat.morphisms

# Create a pattern within our geometric category
# A pattern is a subcategory that represents a specific geometric configuration
# Here we create a pattern with a point and a line, connected by our morphism
geom_pattern = create_pattern(geom_cat, [p1, l1], [f])
@assert length(geom_pattern.objects) == 2
@assert length(geom_pattern.morphisms) == 1
@assert geom_pattern.category == geom_cat
@assert p1 in geom_pattern.objects
@assert l1 in geom_pattern.objects
@assert f in geom_pattern.morphisms
