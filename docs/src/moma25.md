# MoMa25: Monetary Macro Accounting Theory

## Overview
This paper develops a specification for software for macro accounting (MoMa) and a monetary macro accounting theory (MoMaT). It presents a novel approach where money functions as a medium of payment for obligations and debts, rather than just a medium of exchange.

## Key Concepts

### Theoretical Framework
The paper addresses:
- Temporal misalignment in production
- Legal principles of Separation and Abstraction
- Debt, contracts, and property rights
- Multi-level monetary systems analysis

### System Levels
The monetary system operates at three interconnected levels:
1. **Micro Level**: Division of labor facilitation
2. **Meso Level**: Risk sharing in banking
3. **Macro Level**: GDP distribution through issued money

### Core Components

#### Bill of Exchange (BoE)
Serves as:
- Unifying instrument
- Bridge between debt processes
- Money issuing mechanism
- Connection between fiat and gold-based systems

#### Mathematical Foundations
Utilizes:
- Sheaf theory for accounting invariances
- Homology theory for monetary policy
- Open Games for computation
- Multi-agent model analysis

## Applications

### Supply Chain Finance
- Debt networks analysis
- Payment systems integration
- Risk distribution mechanisms
- Financial obligation tracking

### Monetary Policy
- Central banking operations
- Money circulation analysis
- Debt vortices study
- Financial obligation resolution

## Technical Implementation

### Software Components
MoMa implementation can include:
- Macro accounting systems
- Smart contracts
- Structural econometric models
- Data analysis tools

### Mathematical Tools
Proposes:
- Category theory
- Sheaf theory like MES colimits
- Homology theory like MES coregulators
- Game theory

## Future Implications
The framework provides foundations for:
- Macro economic research in monetary systems
- Digital currency development, like stable coins
- Real estate management 
- Renewable energy management systems, virtual power plants
- Economic policy making
