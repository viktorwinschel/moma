# MES07: Memory Evolutive Systems

## Overview
This foundational paper introduces Memory Evolutive Systems (MES) as mathematical models for autonomous evolutionary systems, particularly focusing on biological and social systems, including nervous systems of higher animals. The work is rooted in category theory and represents two decades of research development.

## Key Concepts

### Complexity Characterization
The paper addresses three fundamental problems:
1. **The Binding Problem**: How simple objects combine to form a "whole greater than the sum of its parts"
2. **The Emergence Problem**: How properties of complex objects relate to their elementary components
3. **The Hierarchy Problem**: Explaining the formation of increasingly complex objects, from elementary particles to societies

### Self-Regulation
The paper introduces key characteristics that allow for autonomy through self-regulation:
- Internal regulation systems
- Capacity to recognize environmental characteristics
- Development of appropriate responses
- Introduction of co-regulators (CR) for different hierarchy levels
- Flexible memory systems for **adaptation**

### Cognitive Systems
The paper explores applications to:
- Nervous system modeling
- Cognition processes
- Consciousness modeling
- Development of personal memory (archetypal core)

## Mathematical Framework
The model uses:
- Category theory as the foundational mathematical structure
- Complex systems theory
- Hierarchical evolutive systems based on colimit concepts
- Network theory for co-regulator interactions

## Applications
The framework has applications in:
- Biology
- Medicine
- Sociology
- Ecology
- Economics
- Complex systems analysis

## Historical Context
The work emerged from a collaboration between:
- Jean-Paul Vanbremeersch (physician specializing in gerontology)
- Andr√©e C. Ehresmann (mathematician)
Their collaboration began in 1980, leading to the development of MES theory.
