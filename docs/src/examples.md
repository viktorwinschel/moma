   - Implementation with custom data types (Point, Line)
   - Structured representation of geometric objects and transformations
   - Composition of geometric transformations using morphisms
   - Possible extensions
     - Preservation of geometric invariants through categorical framework
     - Pattern recognition in geometric structures
     - Hierarchical organization of complex geometric systems
     - Category and pattern construction for geometric configurations

## Error Handling
