# MoMa: Central Banks for All

A Julia package implementing a Monetary Macro Accounting (MoMa) of Men√©ndez and Winschel.
To be extended with categorical tools of Memory Evolutive Systems (MES) of Ehresmann and Vanbremeersch.

The monetary theory of MoMa works for national accounting, sectors and companies
but also for within companies as holdings with subsidiaries
and down to smaller levels down like to processes of a box ordering screws.
MoMa is a multi-level accounting theory for macro accounting with different time scales
extending micro accounting aka double-entry bookkeeping.
