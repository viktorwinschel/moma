# Moma.jl Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for `Moma.jl`, a Julia package implementing Memory Evolutive Systems (MES) for complex system modeling and analysis.

## Overview

Moma.jl provides tools for working with Memory Evolutive Systems, a mathematical framework for modeling complex hierarchical systems that evolve over time. The package includes implementations of categorical constructions and practical examples like traffic network analysis.

## Installation

To install Moma.jl, use Julia's package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Moma")
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of creating and analyzing a traffic network:

```julia
using Moma

# Create a traffic network
network = create_traffic_network()

# Analyze traffic flow
results = analyze_traffic_flow(network)
```

## Package Structure

The package consists of two main modules:

- `Categories`: Implements basic categorical constructions used in MES
- `TrafficNetwork`: Provides an example implementation using traffic networks

## Features

### Categorical Constructions

- Objects and morphisms in categories
- Functors and natural transformations
- Pattern matching and colimit finding

### Traffic Network Example

- Road segment and junction modeling
- Traffic flow analysis
- Network state evolution
