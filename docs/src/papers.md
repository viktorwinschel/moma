**Memory Evolutive Systems: Hierarhy, Emergence, Cognition**:
[pdf](assets/mes07.pdf) - A comprehensive synthesis of two decades of research on memory evolutive systems, presenting mathematical models for autonomous evolutionary systems such as biological, social, and nervous systems.

## [MES23](mes23.md)

### Simulation of National Accounting Simulation according to MOMA25

The `src/original_moma` directory contains several files used for generating and checking simulation data
underlying the moma25 paper.

- `momascf_v02_en.jl`: Current simulation file
The following image shows an example of the basic national accounting structure used in the simulation.
