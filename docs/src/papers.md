## Implementation in Moma.jl

The Moma.jl package implements the methodologies and frameworks described in these papers, integrating:
- Memory evolutive systems from MES07
- Human-machine interaction frameworks from MES25
- Monetary macro accounting concepts from MOMA25

For detailed implementation examples, see the [API Reference](api.md).
