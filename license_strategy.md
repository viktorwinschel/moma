# License Strategy

## License

The AGPL license is perfect for now because:
- Keeping code open source
- Requiring network service providers to share modifications
- Maintaining commercial rights while ensuring community benefits
- Protecting against proprietary forks

## GitHub Repository Considerations

### Repository Visibility vs. Licensing
- Repository visibility (public/private) is independent of the license
- Possible combinations:
  - Public repository with open source license
  - Public repository with restrictive license
  - Private repository with open source license
  - Private repository with restrictive license

### GitHub Requirements
- Public repositories don't require specific licenses
- Private repositories are free for individuals (unlimited repos)
- License choice is entirely at the discretion of the repository owner

## Common Scenarios

### Public Repository
- Best practice: Include an open source license
- Without a license, code is technically "all rights reserved"
- Others can view but not legally use the code

### Private Repository
- No license required
- Access controlled by repository owner
- Can be made public later with any license

## License vs Repository Privacy
- License: Defines what others can do with the code
- Repository Privacy: Controls who can see the code

## When to Choose Each Option

### Private Repository
- Developing proprietary code
- Not ready to share code yet
- Client/company confidential work
- Early development stages

### Public Repository
- Want to share with community
- Building open source project
- Creating portfolio work
- Contributing to open source

## Future Considerations
The licensing strategy can evolve as the project grows and commercial opportunities emerge. The AGPL provides strong protection while keeping options open for the future.

### Potential Future Adaptations
1. Update license terms for future versions
2. Offer commercial licensing alongside AGPL (dual licensing)
3. Grant specific exemptions to commercial partners
4. Create separate commercial modules/extensions

### Best Practices
- Document any licensing changes clearly
- Maintain transparency with user community
- Regularly review licensing strategy to align with project goals
- Respect existing AGPL terms while exploring commercial applications
